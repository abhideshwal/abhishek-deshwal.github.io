## Hello!

I am a PhD student in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University. My research focuses on environmental economics and development policy, with particular emphasis on how market distortions and institutional failures affect economic outcomes and climate adaptation in developing countries.

My work spans several interconnected areas: examining how policy-created misallocation undermines climate policies and long-run productivity growth; analyzing how India's agricultural price support (MSP) policies distort farmers' land-use decisions and inhibit climate adaptation; and the importance of demand management policies for renewable energy integration in developing countries. I specialize in both casual inference and methods from empirical industrial organization to quantify impacts of large-scale government interventions.

Before joining Columbia, I worked at the [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) for three years as Senior Research Associate. My work in energy, environment and agriculture in India shaped my current research interests, something I am very grateful for.
