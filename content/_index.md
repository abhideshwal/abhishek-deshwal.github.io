## Hello!

Welcome! I am an economist working at the intersection of environmental and development economics using tools from empirical industrial organization. I use applied microeconomics and interdisciplinary research related to energy markets, environmental policy in developing countries and climate adaption among farmers. 

I am currently a PhD student at the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University. 

Before joining Columbia, I worked at the [Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) for three years as Senior Research Associate.
