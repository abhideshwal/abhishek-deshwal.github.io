tango_text: "Argentine tango has been an important part of my life for three years. The dance represents more than just movement—it's about connection, deep awareness of the other person's senses, listening, and being present in the moment. I seek out tango communities wherever I travel—Greece, Amsterdam, New Delhi, and Paris. My dedication to the dance eventually led me to become President of the Columbia Tango Club in Fall 2024, a position I have held since. I've had the joy of leading the group to Tango festivals at Yale and Princeton. On most Fridays and Saturdays, I find myself at milongas around New York City. Galla Ciego and Volver are my favorite spots."

cooking_text: "I discovered my love for cooking when I started my PhD. I grew up around Indian cuisine, but became particularly drawn to Italian-American food after moving to New York. I treat food as integral to social life and community building—values deeply rooted in my upbringing."

spirituality_text: "At least once a year, I attend Vipassana retreats - in the words of S.N. Goenka, a ten-day deep surgical operation of the mind."

Dancing tango, cooking, and spiritual retreats are passions that have consumed much of my time outside of work for over half a decade.
