  Argentine tango has been an important part of my life for three years. The dance represents more than just movement—it's about connection, deep awareness of the other person's senses, listening, and being present in the moment. I seek out tango communities wherever I travel—Greece, Amsterdam, New Delhi, and Paris. My dedication to the dance eventually led me to become President of the <a href='https://lionlink.columbia.edu/organization/columbiabarnardtango' target='_blank'>Columbia Tango Club</a> in Fall 2024, a position I have held since. I've had the joy of leading the group to Tango festivals at Yale and Princeton. On most Fridays and Saturdays, I find myself at milongas around New York City. <a href='https://milongagallociego.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>Galla Ciego</a> and <a href='https://www.youshouldbedancing.nyc/events/volver-a-nyc-milonga-7x7em-l3se9-6w6p6-a9y33-326em-aj2j6-ngxzd-7cmdz-rc3sp-l3ty9-lhr2m' target='_blank'>Volver</a> are my favorite spots.

  I discovered my love for cooking when I started my PhD. I grew up around Indian cuisine, but became particularly drawn to Italian-American food after moving to New York. I treat food as integral to social life and community building—values deeply rooted in my upbringing. I host dinners whenever I can, and when opportunities arise, I've enjoyed cooking in large kitchens for bigger gatherings. At my favorite <a href='https://www.bluecliffmonastery.org/' target='_blank'>Buddhist monastery</a> in the United States, I always offer to cook meals for the monks and guests. Gratefully, they've enjoyed the food every time. My signature dishes include Mughlai chicken (slow-cooked marinated chicken rich in dry fruits and fried onions), Kerala-style beef roast, and meatballs with spaghetti—each with my own flair.

  At least once a year, I attend <a href='https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index' target='_blank'>Vipassana retreats</a> - in the words of S.N. Goenka, a ten-day "deep surgical operation of the mind". Seeing things as they really are through 9 hour daily meditation sittings, and mindful eating have deeply shaped my perspective on life.

Dancing tango, cooking, and spiritual retreats are passions that have consumed much of my time outside of work for over half a decade. These are spaces where my mind can wander freely - they serve as creative outlets, channels to recover from fatigue and regenerate the mind. These activities shape who I am outside academic life.
