# Tango content
tango_text: "Argentine tango has been a profound part of my life for [X years]. The dance represents more than just movementâ€”it's about connection, listening, and being present in the moment. From the milongas of Buenos Aires to local dance communities, tango has taught me about vulnerability, partnership, and the poetry of improvised movement. The music of Piazzolla, D'Arienzo, and Pugliese continues to move me, both literally and emotionally."

Food, after all, is one of our most fundamental ways of caring for others."
