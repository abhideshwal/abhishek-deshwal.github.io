   Optimal climate policy such as carbon pricing works by efficiently reallocating production to reflect social costs. However, in many developing countries, there is widespread misallocation in production - preexisting tax wedges systematically burden the most productive firms while protecting less efficient ones. When these productive firms also have lower emissions, carbon taxes create a fundamental allocation problem: they may preserve production from dirty, inefficient incumbents while accelerating the exit of clean, efficient producers. This paper demonstrates that when distortions are negatively correlated with marginal emissions across producers, removing preexisting sources of misallocation can deliver larger emissions reductions than carbon taxes themselves. I apply this theoretical insight to India's electricity generation industry, where administrative coal allocation creates a $4 billion annual misallocation by granting inefficient, high-emission state-owned plants preferential access to subsidized coal while forcing efficient, clean private generators to pay market prices. I build a structural model of electricity generation to show that removing these distortions achieves CO2 reductions equivalent to a $40/ton carbon tax while generating welfare gains 2.4 times larger. Distortion removal reallocates 20% of production from the dirtiest to cleanest plants, while a $20/ton carbon tax applied to the distorted system achieves only 2.5% reallocation. Moreover, at every tax rate from $20-100/ton, carbon taxes would be 130-270% more effective if underlying distortions were removed first, representing $3.8 billion in additional annual climate damages. These findings suggest that in heavily distorted economies with weak regulation, efficiency-enhancing reforms can serve as environmental policy itself, offering a more feasible path than traditional climate policies.

   We study how government-created distortions in upstream coal markets affect long-run productivity growth in India's electricity industry. The government coal monopoly administratively allocates subsidized coal primarily to inefficient state-owned plants while forcing efficient private generators to purchase coal at market prices often 1.5-2 times higher. Using plant-level data for 2006-2017 and detailed administrative records of coal supply contracts, we measure productivity and distortions directly, avoiding empirical challenges associated with production function estimation. Coal policy changes reduced expected subsidized coal access for private generators from 90% to 38% during this period of substantial private entry. We estimate a dynamic oligopoly model for coal-fired generators that recovers firms' beliefs about future coal availability and quantify how these distortions affected investment decisions. Preliminary findings suggest that removing these distortions affects long-run productivity growth through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct reallocation from subsidized inefficient state plants to unsubsidized efficient private plants, and (ii) increased investment by efficient private generators responding to improved expected profitability. Together, coal price deregulation would significantly alter the long-run distribution of productivity and aggregate industry outcomes.

  abstract: >
    As climate risks intensify, government programs that traditionally protect farmer incomes may discourage long-term adaptation to climate change. India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) policies support millions of farmers through guaranteed procurement prices, but most transfers flow toward water-intensive crops such as rice and sugarcane - both extremely vulnerable to droughts. I find that MSP-covered crops experience yield losses 60% larger during droughts compared to non-MSP crops. To quantify equilibrium impacts, I develop and estimate a dynamic structural model of land use that incorporates farmer decision-making under risk, variation in MSP access, and crop switching costs. Using the estimated structural parameters, I simulate counterfactual equilibria in which these policies are reformed. Preliminary evidence suggests that current price support generates crop lock-in by delaying adoption of climate-resilient crops, increasing production volatility and reducing welfare.
