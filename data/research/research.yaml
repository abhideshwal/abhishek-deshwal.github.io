   Optimal climate policy such as carbon pricing works by efficiently reallocating production to reflect social costs. However, in many developing countries, there is widespread misallocation in production - preexisting tax wedges systematically burden the most productive firms while protecting less efficient ones. When these productive firms also have lower emissions, carbon taxes create a fundamental allocation problem: they may preserve production from dirty, inefficient incumbents while accelerating the exit of clean, efficient producers. This paper demonstrates that when distortions are negatively correlated with marginal emissions across producers, removing preexisting sources of misallocation can deliver larger emissions reductions than carbon taxes themselves. I apply this theoretical insight to India's electricity generation industry, where administrative coal allocation creates a $4 billion annual misallocation by granting inefficient, high-emission state-owned plants preferential access to subsidized coal while forcing efficient, clean private generators to pay market prices. I build a structural model of electricity generation to show that removing these distortions achieves CO<sub>2</sub> reductions equivalent to a $40/ton carbon tax while generating welfare gains 2.4 times larger. Distortion removal reallocates 20% of production from the dirtiest to cleanest plants, while a $20/ton carbon tax applied to the distorted system achieves only 2.5% reallocation. Moreover, at every tax rate from $20-100/ton, carbon taxes would be 130-270% more effective if underlying distortions were removed first, representing $3.8 billion in additional annual climate damages. These findings suggest that in heavily distorted economies with weak regulation, efficiency-enhancing reforms can serve as environmental policy itself, offering a more feasible path than traditional climate policies.

   We study how government-created distortions in upstream coal markets affect long-run productivity growth in India's electricity industry. The government coal monopoly administratively allocates subsidized coal primarily to inefficient state-owned plants while forcing efficient private generators to purchase coal at market prices often 1.5-2 times higher. Using plant-level data for 2006-2017 and detailed administrative records of coal supply contracts, we measure productivity and distortions directly, avoiding empirical challenges associated with production function estimation. Coal policy changes reduced expected subsidized coal access for private generators from 90% to 38% during this period of substantial private entry. We estimate a dynamic oligopoly model for coal-fired generators that recovers firms' beliefs about future coal availability and quantify how these distortions affected investment decisions. Preliminary findings suggest that removing these distortions affects long-run productivity growth through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct reallocation from subsidized inefficient state plants to unsubsidized efficient private plants, and (ii) increased investment by efficient private generators responding to improved expected profitability. Together, coal price deregulation would substantially alter the long-run distribution of productivity and aggregate industry outcomes.

    I study how well people understand, reason, and learn about four economic policies: i) Personal income taxation, ii) Estate taxation, iii) Health insurance, and iv) Trade. To that end, I run large-scale online surveys and experiments on representative U.S. samples to elicit not only respondents' factual knowledge about policies and the underlying economic phenomena, but also their understanding of the mechanisms of each policy and their reasoning. The detailed survey questions are designed to address the three main factors that can shape support for or opposition to various policies: efficiency effects, distributional implications, and fairness considerations. To extract people's first-order considerations that come to mind when they are prompted to think about a given policy, its shortcomings, and goals without priming them, open-ended questions are used and then evaluated with text analysis methods. There are partisan divergences of varying magnitudes and significance, not just in the final policy views, but also in reasonings about the underlying mechanisms. Respondents are in many cases likely to think of themselves as responding differently and facing different consequences from other people. Women in particular tend to consider themselves and other women as less responsive to income and estate taxes. Health insurance considerations are also intertwined with gender considerations and views on female health concerns and services are starkly divided. I experimentally show people instructional videos that explain the workings and consequences of each policy from three different perspectives. The "Distributional" perspective focuses on the distributional consequences of each policy; the "Efficiency" perspective focuses on the efficiency costs; the "Economist" perspectives focuses on the trade-off, combining both the distributional and efficiency perspectives together. Respondents do change some of their views about the mechanisms and the desirable design of some policies after seeing the instructional videos. The possibility to influence at least the perceived mechanisms of and sometimes even support for given policies suggests that perhaps explanations (rather than the provision of simple facts) can be useful as a first step in elevating the policy debate.
